# OCR to Quizlet set
### This is just an experiment

I have to study over 100 Spanish terms because I decided to take AP Spanish 3 for some reason. I made this quick because I didn't want to make the Quizlet myself. I also wasted all my studying time writing this. It works, but not the best. I will remake a real verson using a Quizlet API wrapper or requests like it should've been done in the first place. Feel free to take from this. A lot of the OCR, translation stuff, and Selenium stuff will work great on their own. Anyways, I have a test to study for.
